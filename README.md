# SIT2003 Stochastic Process: A Markov State Transition Model (Modelling Smartphone Usage) by R

Analysis on
- basic Markov model 
- finite non-absorbing chain

by markovchain package in R

Screen events that can be observed on smartphones are- 
- 0: turned on (power to the screen has been activated)
- 1: turned off (power to the screen has stopped)
- 2: locked (screen locked to avoid accidental input)
- 3: unlocked (screen unlocked so that input is enabled)
